demo_005,murillo.png,,Murillo Velarde Map,,,"The second colonial century (1665-1774) can be remembered for the appearance of bibingca and monay in Tagalog, the introduction for cultivation of hand-size mangos from India, the spread of cacao that had come at the end of the first century, and the Murillo Map. The map prepared by Father Pedro Murillo Velarde, SJ and published in 1734 sports an abbreviated history of Filipinas in a decorative medallion towards the bottom of the map. There were 568 towns administered by secular clergy, Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, Jesuits and Recollects. All in all they serviced 639,683 new Christians. Although seculars managed the most number of towns, 142, it was Augustinians who cared for the largest segment: 292,973 souls in 115 towns. Murillo noted among the archipelago's riches sugar, honey, ginger, cacao, seashells, rice, salt, wheat, maize, lemons, oranges, bananas and many fruits, edible roots, tamarind, coconut, many kinds of palms, carabaos, cows, pigs, deer, chickens and much fish. There were also many medicinal herbs. He added that in Mindanao, cinnamon and [black] pepper grew wild. The listing combines precolonial and colonial flora and fauna all flourishing. An observation worth mulling over is that Manila [the colonial capital] had acquired a cosmopolitan spirit from its commerce with China and New Spain. There were people from Europe, Africa, Asia and the American continents including men from Armenia and Malabar. Peace and prosperity reigned in between conflicts with England, Spain's enemy of the era. Murillo criticised the Spanish who arrived in Filipinas but did not develop the colony or leave a lasting imprint. Such was the situation in the colony. CTTO Illustration on the Murillo Map's frame.
