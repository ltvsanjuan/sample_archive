demo_001,armynavy.png,,Friendly Cocktails,,24/09/2021,"The Army-Navy Club for American officers was across Manila Hotel. The Club was known for ADIOS AMIGOS, its cocktail probably so strong it could knock one out. Shake well with lots of cracked ice: Bacardi, 2 ponies; French Bermouth, 1 pony; Cognac, 1 pony; juice of 1/2 lemon or lime; Dry gin, 1 pony. Pour into a large flat champagne glass, ""and send for the Marines!"" PORTO FLIP, 1931 Army-Navy PI. ""Send this up on the breakfast tray of the ... most jangled week-end guest on the casualty list ... be sure it goes down on an empty tummy for the best and most soothing effect,"" suggests Charles Baker. Mix together and shake hard with lots of cracked ice: Port wine, 2 jiggers; 1 whole fresh egg; thick cream, 1 pony; Cognac, 1 pony; sugar, 2 scant tsp. Serve in a small goblet, floating 1 tsp chartreuse on top with a spoon. Add a good dusting of grated nutmeg. CTTO The original Bacardi distillery in Santiago de Cuba. By PuedaHacer. Wikimedia.commons. Bacardi was founded in 1862 by Don Facundo Bacardi Masso. He upscaled rum by ""taming"" its spirit and produced the first white rum that enamoured the world. The brand works out of Florida now and has a descendent of the founder on the board. Bacardi became known as the king of rum and the rum of kings. It was still a Spanish colony like Filipinas in 1862 (a year after Rizal was born).",Army-Navy Club; Adios Amigos; Porto Flip; Charles Baker; cocktail,Manila,14.58375227,120.9741096,https://www.instagram.com/p/CUMjanBBIrL/,,Image;StillImage,image/png,eng,,
demo_002,baca.png,,Ingredients (10),,29/09/2021,"In the Spanish-Tagalog section of the dictionary, a place where meat is sold to the public was called PATAYAN and TINDAHAN NG LAMANG CATI. Palengke, tienda, even tindahan do not figure among the Tagalog words. TINDAHAN is only in the Spanish section of the dictionary. BILI is the Tagalog term for to buy and to sell. Beef and how to cook it arrived with the Spanish. When did Filipino food start to include steaks? Possibly not by 1745. Let us see what later dictionaries will reveal.

demo_003,fruits.png,,Ingredients (8),,25/09/2021,"Fruits were important to the Tagalog diet. Bananas had many varieties but some are hardly known today: BANGALAN, BINGTICOHOL, BONGCOLAN, BOSOGAN, CALABONDO, DINUGUAN, GALAYAN, OBISPO, SABA, SACSIC, SAGING LIGAO, SAGING MACHING, MATAVIA, SANTAN, the large TARYANG ANUANG, TONDOC, finger-like TORLONG BINOCOT also called TORLONG DATO. One wonders if BOTHOAN was the variety with many seeds desired not for eating but for its strong leaves used as wrappers. Other kinds of banana were introduced into the 20th century. They were bred to withstand the rigours of transport for domestic and global shipments. In 1754 there also were fruits such as ALIPAY, BALOBO, NANGCA, SAMPALOC, and the TAMPOY known for its fragrance and delicious taste. CAMANSALAY and sweet sour LANSONES fruits grew in clusters like grapes. There were native citrus: the tiny sweet sour CALAMUNDING also known as CALDAMUNDI; the large orange (""naranja"" in Spanish) called SOHA and LUCBAN interchangeably. SO-A appears as a separate entry and is defined as an orange like the Spanish kind. CAMANGSI is eaten cooked today. We wonder about the edible fruits COBONG and CUBILI that grew on trees. PINYA introduced from the Americas had become a Tagalog word as had MANGA introduced from India. It's sad that fruit heritage from the 1700s is hardly known anymore and just as culinary tourism encourages appreciation for what makes cuisines unique. CTTO. CAMANSI (Artocarpus camansi) or breadnut is said to be the wild ancestor of cultivated breadfruit, RIMAS. A third Artocarpus is LANGKA, jackfruit in Filipino. From Flora de Filipinas.

demo_004,import.png,,Ingredients (7),,22/09/2021,"Some foreign ingredients had established themselves enough to have become part of Tagalog in 1754: CAMATIS (tomato brought in during the first century); PASITI (a minute chili that grew wild and that is likely today's LABUYO; labuyo means ""wild""). There were CONDOL, an Asian gourd; OPO, a gourd that may have originated in Asia; PATOLA an Asian luffa. CONDOL was also known in Tagalog as SICOT and TIBYAYONG. Spanish classified the Asian gourds as CALABASA, squash. ALIBANGBANG and SIBUG leaves were used in lieu of vinegar, meaning they gave desired sourness. MAGSIBUG was to add SIBUG to what one was cooking. CALITCALIT, DAMPALIT, and LIBATO [alugbati] were other ""yerbas"" or CULINARY herbs. PACQUILING leaves flavoured rice [during cooking by lining the pot[. SAMPALOC remained on the list as the native word for tamarind meaning Indian Date in Arabic. Seeds of TALISAY trees were edible and reminded of pine nuts. There were AMAPALAYA bittermelon, TALONG eggplant, and the wild eggplant called TARAMPOLA. Noceda-Sanlucar include GILAY:  a genus of edible herbs. Francisco San Antonio's GULAY in his Tagalog dictionary of 1624 are herbs such as BERSAS (collard greens or probably their likeness), NABOS (turnips), etc. that are tossed into a pot that has meat in it. His definition of GILAY is edible herbs. Dictionary compilers were becoming increasingly familiar with native ingredients just as foreign new botanicals were finding new homes in the Philippines.

demo_005,murillo.png,,Murillo Velarde Map,,19/09/2021,"The second colonial century (1665-1774) can be remembered for the appearance of bibingca and monay in Tagalog, the introduction for cultivation of hand-size mangos from India, the spread of cacao that had come at the end of the first century, and the Murillo Map. The map prepared by Father Pedro Murillo Velarde, SJ and published in 1734 sports an abbreviated history of Filipinas in a decorative medallion towards the bottom of the map. There were 568 towns administered by secular clergy, Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, Jesuits and Recollects. All in all they serviced 639,683 new Christians. Although seculars managed the most number of towns, 142, it was Augustinians who cared for the largest segment: 292,973 souls in 115 towns. Murillo noted among the archipelago's riches sugar, honey, ginger, cacao, seashells, rice, salt, wheat, maize, lemons, oranges, bananas and many fruits, edible roots, tamarind, coconut, many kinds of palms, carabaos, cows, pigs, deer, chickens and much fish. There were also many medicinal herbs. He added that in Mindanao, cinnamon and [black] pepper grew wild. The listing combines precolonial and colonial flora and fauna all flourishing. An observation worth mulling over is that Manila [the colonial capital] had acquired a cosmopolitan spirit from its commerce with China and New Spain. There were people from Europe, Africa, Asia and the American continents including men from Armenia and Malabar. Peace and prosperity reigned in between conflicts with England, Spain's enemy of the era. Murillo criticised the Spanish who arrived in Filipinas but did not develop the colony or leave a lasting imprint. Such was the situation in the colony. CTTO Illustration on the Murillo Map's frame.
